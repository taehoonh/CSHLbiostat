### Biostatistics Support Letter

A strong support letter from a biostatistician can significantly bolster your grant application. Our biostatistician will provide a detailed letter that outlines the statistical methodologies, data analysis plans, and the significance of biostatistical input in your study. This letter demonstrates the robustness of your research design and the credibility of your lab. For an example of a biostatistics support letter, please see the attached image below:

### Power Calculation and Sample Size Justification

Determining the right sample size is essential for achieving valid and reliable results. We will conduct rigorous power calculations to ensure your study is adequately powered to detect meaningful effects. Our team will also provide a detailed justification for the chosen sample size, which is a critical component of your grant proposal.

### Biosketch

Certain funding organizations, such as the National Insitute of Health (NIH), require a biosketch – a detailed resume of the biostatistician involved in your project. If needed, we will the biostatistician's biosketch. These biosketches will highlight the biostatistician's expertise, qualifications, and key contributions, demonstrating the biostatistician's critical role in your proposed research.
